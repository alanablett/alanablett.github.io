excerpt: Overthinking aint no fun!
---

I have a real issue with procrastination. It eats away at me and refuses to release its hold over my actions. Things really start to get horrible once you add a bout of perfectionism into the mix. Its like for all the good intentions I have, I seem to bow down to the pressure that its not good enough, and that people won’t be interested in what I have to say. Besides, far more clever people have already done and said anything I could contribute – right? **WRONG**!

Although I might not be the smartest, the clearest, the quickest, or the best; I’ve come to realise that there really is no time like the present. So I gave myself 2 days to put my site together and actually get myself online. Besides, how can I claim to be a professional in the field without having a site of my own?

Another primary reason for getting it done is because I’ve always got a real buzz from being able to contribute to others, and watching the “AH-HA” moments unfold before me. So now that I’m here, I’m hoping (read going) to start writing some posts based on my own experiences writing software, and some of the important lessons that I have learned along the way.

So take a leaf out of my book, stop procrastinating and give yourself a deadline. Meet that deadline and ship it! You can always refine it later.
